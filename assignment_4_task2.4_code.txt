# ASSIGNMENT 4 : Task 2.4:

Create a DatetimeIndex that contains each business day of 2015 and use it to index a Series of 
random numbers.

Find Average For each calendar month

## NOTE: Please refer README.md file to get instruction to run the program

### Code: 
		
		import numpy as np
		import pandas as pd

		#business days of 2015
		b_dates = pd.bdate_range('2015-01-01', '2015-12-31')

		#Use business day of 2015 as index to a series of random numbers
		b_dates_index = pd.Series(np.random.randn(len(b_dates)), index=b_dates)
		#b_dates_index
		
		df = pd.DataFrame({'numbers': np.random.randn(len(b_dates)), 'dates': b_dates})
		
		# Set a new column of month of each dates to get the avarage for each calender month
		df['month'] = df['dates'].dt.month
		
		#conditional group by to select each calender month and then apply mean() to get the average of each month
		avg_cal_month = df.groupby('month').mean()
		
		print('Average for each calendar month:\n')
		print(avg_cal_month)
